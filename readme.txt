We were given two coding assignments in the course CS F372 - Operating Systems in Bits Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. The aim of the assignments was to make use of existing linux compliant libraries in C language and write OS level code for real-life scenarios.

Assignment 1:
The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate the working of various IPC(Inter-process communication) functionalities such as Shared Memory, Message queues, etc.

Assignment 2:
The goal of this assignment was to develop a full-scale elevator management system that can handle multiple elevators and multiple passengers. The target was to minimise the number of elevator movements + turns taken. I have achieved this by using greedy logic for both passenger assignment and movement of elevator. Greedy seemed to be the most obvious and intuitive approach to handle this problem.
